## Goals of this demonstration

We will use [LANDFIRE](https://landfire.gov/){target="blank"} products to:

1. Characterize and map past and present ecosystem conditions.
2. Explore historical disturbance patterns.
3. Summarize patterns of change and management opportunities.


The following charts, maps, and graphs are based on current LANDFIRE products, and provide a starting point for further analysis.

This demonstration will:

* Provide context for the past and present ecosystem conditions the [Ouachita National Forest](https://www.fs.usda.gov/ouachita){target='blank'}.
* Demonstrate the power of data visualization to explore ecological patterns and functions using LANDFIRE products.
* Facilitate an understanding of historical and current conditions on a regional scale.
