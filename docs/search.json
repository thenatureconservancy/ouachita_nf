    "text": "Summary\n\nHistorically, more than 80% of the Ouachita National Forest was covered by the Ozark-Ouachita Shortleaf Pine-Oak Forest and Woodland. Much of the composition of the woodlands and forests was a function of changes in slope and aspect, with more open, pine and dry oak communities occurring on dry, south facing slopes, and denser, more mesic, oak communities concentrated on wetter north facing slopes.\nThe Ozark-Ouachita Shortleaf-Pine Bluestem Woodland covered more than 25% of the area, a Biophysical Setting characterized by a shortleaf pine dominated canopy (Pinus echinata) and open understory dominated by big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), little bluestem (Schizachium scoparium), and other sun loving plants species more often observed in prairie communities. Much of this setting occurred on the large, more gently sloping east/west ridges of the Ouachitas Mountains, on primarily sandstone and shale substrates.\nMore than 95% of the Ouachita National Forest had a Mean Fire Return Interval (MFRI) of 20 years or less, with roughly 40% having a MFRI of less than 5 years.\nSurface fire was by far, the most prevalent historic disturbance.\nOverall, more than 600,000 acres of surface fire burned throughout the Ouachita National Forest per year, with roughly 300,000 acres burning through the ‘Ozark-Ouachita Shortleaf Pine-Bluestem Woodland’ ecosystem. Native grazing was the second-most common disturbance, but was low in comparison to fire disturbance, affecting roughly 30,000 acres per year."

However, some patterns are worth noting:\n\nThere has been a broad-scale change from ‘hardwood’ type to more ‘conifer’ types. Likely due primarily to conversion of hardwood to pine for timber production.\nThere has been some conversion from past conifer, past hardwood, past hardwood-conifer, and past grassland to developed and agricultural types, though overall, the forest remains heavily forested.\nAcres of grassland have been dramatically reduced. Almost all of the past 30,000 acres of grassland have been converted to agriculture, exotic, and forested types.\nExotic types now represent roughly 55,000 acres of the forest.\n\nNote: number presented when hovering equals acres."

Succession class E is characterized as closed canopy (&gt;71% canopy cover) with a sparse herbaceous understory. As fire has been identified as the most prevalent disturbance on this landscape, this shift is presumably due to lack of fire on the landscape.\nThe ‘Ozark-Ouachita Shortleaf Pine-Bluestem Woodland’ community had the most dramatic shift in succession class, with much of the past Succession Class D and C, described as mid to late-seral woodland savannah, with pine oak overstory and bluestem grass understory, shifting to closed canopy forest (Succession Class E).\nAll three ecosystems had dramatic reductions in Succession Classes A, B, and C. These succession classes are early and mid development classes, with seedling and sapling trees (Class A) to midstory trees (&lt; 10m tree height) (Class B and C). Overall, this trend suggests that in the past, higher intensity and frequency of disturbance (primarily fire) shifted ecosystems into, and maintained, these earlier succession classes."

Care should be taken when directly comparing past and present maps, as classification systems for Biophysical Settings do not always align with the most current NatureServe (2016) ecosystem descriptions. With this caveat in mind, some patterns are worth noting:\n\nShortleaf pine and oak dominated systems are still the most prevalent vegetation types on the forest, though much of the vegetation types have shifted from “woodland” descriptions to more “forest” descriptions, indicating an increase in canopy cover.\nThe most prevalent past Biophysical Setting, Ozark-Ouachita Shortleaf Pine-Oak Forest and Woodland is no longer the most prevalent vegetation type. Large areas of in the central and southeastern portion of the forest appear to have been converted to pasture and plantation, presumably due to the low gradient associated with this community.\nThe southwestern portion of the forest represents the most development, with the majority of the area now converted from West Gulf Coastal Plain Pine-Hardwood Forest and Gulf and Atlantic Coastal Plain Floodplain Systems to pasture and plantation.\nThe Ouachita National Forest remains heavily forested, as indicated by the EVC and EVH."
